# GraphQL Resources

Here's a collection of resources that I've found during my escapades into the GraphQL Ecosystem

## Official Documentation

http://graphql.org/

## Services

* Apollo Client - https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client
* Graph.cool - GraphQL Backend - https://www.graph.cool/
* Scaphold.io - GraphQL Backend as a Service - https://scaphold.io/

Graph.cool seems to be more composed than Scaphold as of now. They also have a decent documentation on creating GraphQL schemas. I'd recommend reading through them, even if you're using GraphQL only on the client-side as it may help you understand the structure of a database better. 

## Apollo Client Docs

* http://www.graphql.com/guides/
* https://www.learnapollo.com/
* https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/full-stack-react-graphql-tutorial-582ac8d24e3b?_ga=2.20383996.514826324.1499989222-1467687863.1499292889

I personally used Learn Apollo. They have a simple, easy-to-use, and comprehensive tutorial that guides you to build a reactive Pokédex application using an exisiting Pokémon database provided by graph.cool.
